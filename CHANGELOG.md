# Change Log
## Version 0.2.1
- Fixed the flag editor to allow simultaneous selection of water and lava surface flags, enabling the creation of 'cold water' surface types.
- Changed keyboard shortcut for View-To-Grid command in the Map Editor [PR #36](https://github.com/smlu/SED/pull/36) 
- Updated keyboard key commands in 3D Preview [PR #36](https://github.com/smlu/SED/pull/36) 

## Version 0.2.0
- Fixed division by zero in `FindUVScales` function.
- Fixed calculating yaw & roll angles in `TMatrix43.ExtractPYR` function.
- Fixed scaling color component when recoding MAT texture pixel to destination format.  
  This fixes the issue with the color component being scaled to 0xFF when recoding from 16-bit to 24-bit or 32-bit format and vice versa.  
  In essence, it affects the texture color, especially the alpha channel where solid textures with alpha channel were not fully opaque due to now fixed scaling issue.
- Replaced unit `GLunit` with `dglOpenGL` to support OpenGL up to version 4.6.
- Removed obsolete and unused code & units.

- Map Editor
  * Deprecated software renderer in favor of OpenGL renderer.
  * Renamed renderer units

- 3D Preview:
  * Implemented horizon sky rendering in 3D preview (OpenGL only) [PR #35](https://github.com/smlu/SED/pull/35)
  * Added selection no-clip option to 3D preview settings. [PR #28](https://github.com/smlu/SED/pull/28)
  * Fixed acquisition/release of OpenGL context in `TOGLPRenderer` class.  
  * Fixed thing/surface selection in 3D preview when OpenGL is used.
  * Fixed 'Snap Grid to Item' and 'Cleave by Grid' hotkeys [PR #31](https://github.com/smlu/SED/pull/31)
  * Fixed ceiling sky depth to fall behind the level geometry and thing objects.
  * Deprecated DirectX GAPI: The DirectX Graphics API is being deprecated in favor of OpenGL.  
    The DirectX GAPI will be removed in the next major release.
  * Fixed incorrect sort range when flushing cached polygon
  * Fixed transparency rendering issues by improving distance calculation for sorting transparent polygons.  
    Now using full 3D world space distance from vertex to camera position instead of comparing vertices forward (y-axis) values,  
    which ensures correct rendering of overlapping transparent objects, especially in OpenGL.
  * Fixed rendering of translucent polygons in OpenGL by enabling alpha testing.
  * Updated OpenGL preview renderer to use curCamera FOV.
  * Refactored OpenGL renderer to replace all immediateâ€‘mode (glBegin/glEnd) draws with batched dynamic VBO/IBO updates and single glDrawElements.
  * Renamed renderer units
